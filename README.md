# Image-Cryptography-Using-Image-Key
This is the module for Encrypting and Decrypting Images Using Another Image as the key

##Encryption
The desired image is renamed key.jpg and then used to replace the dummy key.
The orignal jpg files go in the Orignal directory and the dummy file is removed and then EncryptInDirectory.py is run.
This will encrypt the images and place them in Encrypted directory

##Decryption
The desired image is renamed key.jpg and then used to replace the dummy key.
The encrypted jpg files go in the Encrypted directory and the dummy file is removed and then DecryptInDirectory.py is run.
This will encrypt the images and place them in Decrypted directory.
Please make sure, that the files names is the same as the one when it was encrypted
